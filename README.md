MyEntertainment is based on Firebase Realtime Database, which provides signing up, signing in and is a database for storing user's movies/books/games/music.

Project was built according to MVVM architecture pattern. It uses Dagger2 for dependency injection. 

As a work is still in progress, application - for now - doesn't allow to delete or edit items, but those functionalities are going to be allowed in the near future.
