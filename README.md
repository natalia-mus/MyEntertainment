MyEntertainment is based on Firebase Realtime Database, which is a database for storing user's movies/books/games/music. Firebase also provides authorization.

Project was built according to MVVM architecture pattern. It uses Dagger2 for dependency injection. 

As a work is still in progress, application - for now - doesn't allow to edit items, but this functionality is going to be allowed in the near future.

### <b> update: </b>
